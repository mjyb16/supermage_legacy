SuperMAGE: **Super**\ massive black hole **ma**\ sses from **g**\ as
kin\ **e**\ matics

While gas dynamical SMBH mass measurement is SuperMAGE's primary use
case, as a modular simulator, you can use any of its modules for any
purpose. Broadly speaking, if you work with spectral cubes and/or
rotation curves in galaxies, you might find SuperMAGE useful for your
work.

NOTE: Active development. Non-functioning and untested code may occur.
For notebooks, see other repo.
